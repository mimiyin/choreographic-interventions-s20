# Choreographic Interventions Syllabus - Spring 2019

- Spring 2020, Wednesdays 1:10-2:25PM (Barnard-only), Fridays 2-5PM
- Locations:
   - The Media Commons at 370 Jay Street, Brooklyn NY
   - The Movement Lab at Barnard College, Manhattan, NY
- [Detailed schedule for Times and Locations]()
- Instructors: Mimi Yin, mimi.yin@nyu.edu, NiNi Dongnier
- [Office Hours Signup](https://itp.nyu.edu/inwiki/Signup/Mimi)

### Course Structure | [See introductory description below.](#course-description)

Over the course of the semester, we will cover 3 topic areas that correspond to 3 parameters of choreography: Pathways, The Body and Space. Topics will be introduced through movement-based improvisation exercises. Computational strategies will be examined through code examples. For each topic, students will create small movement studies with the aim of fully exploring how technology "intervenes" and changes the choreographic process.

The class will culminate in a showing of student work. The final project will take the form of a live performance.

This class runs in conjunction with a course in the Barnard/Columbia Dance Department and will comprise of students from both NYU and Barnard/Columbia.

Because course topics are organized around movement concepts, technical topics will be introduced and built upon week to week.
- What do cameras see? What don't they see?
- Skeletons, Depth Maps and Contours
- Position versus speed of movement
- Scaling and Mapping values
- 2D Position tracking
- 2D Projection mapping
- Computational approaches to choreographing pathways of motion
- Computational approaches to dividing and defining space
- Modes of interaction

"Soft Skills" we will practice:
- Sketching (as in drawing on paper) choreographic ideas.
- Designing and defining rule sets for movement.
- Designing and defining rules of interaction.
- Deconstructing choreography into parameters for code.
- Extracting choreographic ideas from code.

### Workbook
Each topic will be introduced through paper-based drawing exercises and code examples. [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EnB6lxoawC9muXulMDiB2n_0ipdnyelR?usp=sharing)

## Week 8: Going fullScreen()

### Questions
   * How does the webcam define space?
   * How does the laptop screen define space?
   * What does it mean to interact with these virtual spaces through movement?
   * How do these spaces re-define the relationship between performer and audience?

### Assignment: Explore Online-As-Space
   * Play with the examples above.
   * Please post both your written response and chair dance study by 10AM Friday so that we have enough time on Friday to review and respond to the material before class. Before class, I will ask you review everyone's examples of online performance and chair studies as well as leave written responses on at least 3 other people's work.
   * Write a short response to the following examples of online performance. (~3-5 sentences about each example.) What's the angle? Would it be possible in a live theater set-up? Would it be the same performance? What would be lost? Add a 4th of your own to analyze. It doesn't need to be a dance performance. It doesn't even need to be good! Just thought provoking about the medium.

### Week 9 Assignment
   * Collect source material this week: Sound, visuals, video, choreography, text, diagrams, drawings, storyboards and stick them in [your folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16UK7YpFvYBepmJH7AlqXUU5NVLXNvXrq?usp=sharing).
   * Prepare material to show in class: 3 choreographic ideas. 1 sketch. (You can make more than that.)
      * [Sign-up for a timeslot to work and post your sketches here](https://github.com/mimiyin/choreographic-interventions-s20/wiki/Assignments)

Over the next 4 weeks, in groups of 3-4, create a movement-based interactive work that explores one or more modes of interaction and one or more of parameters of choreography from this course. The work can take the form of an installation or a performance. Installations can be time-based or persistent with no definitive start or end time. The only requirement is that the choreography must be interactive, meaning the performers are making choreographic decisions in real-time. This doesn’t mean there is no element of pre-set choreography, however there must be room in the choreographic structure for individual decision-making. You will have a maximum of 10 minutes to show your work. Each group will consist of 1-2 students from ITP and 1-2 students from Barnard.

## Showing: Week 12

# Course Description
This course re-conceives interactive media as a form of choreographic intervention. Instead of asking how moving bodies can control media, we will ask how rules of interaction can structure the composition of a dance.

To accomplish this, the class facilitates a semester-long collaboration between ITP students and dancers from the Barnard/Columbia Dance Department. Choreographers will learn to apply computational thinking to choreography and creative coders will learn to apply choreographic thinking to computation. To whatever extent possible, we will attempt to embody code.

Using computer vision and visual media, we will look at directing both how people move (quality of movement) as well as where they move (pathways and spatial relationships).

We will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the various sensing technologies available to us today. How wide is the gulf between what we can see and feel (strength, hardness, contortion) and what a computer can see and interpret (locations, contours, velocity)? Class time will be split between movement exercises, playing with examples and deconstructing code.

The class will culminate in a final showing of student work.

All classes will take place at NYU with a separate weekly technical lab for ITP students.		  		  		  		  

## Pre-requisites
The course is intended both for anyone looking to deepen their practice in working with movement-based interaction regardless of previous experience with movement technique or programming.

As a result, there is no pre-requisite for dance and no pre-requisite for code.

## Evaluation
- 40% for showing up (on time!) and participating with curiosity and enthusiasm.
- 15% for each topic study. (Pathways and Body)
- 30% for the final project.
- More than 2 unexcused absences qualifies you for a failure.
- 2 lateness of 15 minutes or more qualifies as 1 unexcused absence.

Please see ITP's statement on [Pass/Fail](http://help.itp.nyu.edu/academic-policies/pass-fail) which states that a "Pass" is equivalent to an "A" or a "B" while anything less would be considered a "Fail".

We will have weekly assignments that are relevant to material from the previous class. These assignments are required and you should be prepared to show/talk about them in class. It is expected that everyone in the class will create and maintain a blog for their assignments.

Attendance is mandatory. Please inform your teacher via email if you are going to miss a class. Two unexcused absences is cause for failing the class. (An unexcused lateness of 10 minutes or more is equivalent to 1/2 an absence.)

This class will be participatory, you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and participate with their projects. This (along with attendance) is 40% of your grade.

Class will culminate with final projects. You are expected to push your abilities to produce something that utilizes what you have learned in the class that is useful in some manner to yourself or the world. This will comprise 20% of your grade.

## Statement of Academic Integrity

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

## Statement of Principle

The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members.  It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice.  Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.  For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook, which can be found online at: http://students.tisch.nyu.edu/page/home.html

## Statement on Accessibility

Please feel free to make suggestions to your instructor about ways in which this class could become more accessible to you.  Academic accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212 998-4980 for further information.

## Statement on Counseling and Wellness

Your health and safety are a priority at NYU. If you experience any health or mental health issues during this course, we encourage you to utilize the support services of the 24/7 NYU Wellness Exchange 212-443-9999. Also, all students who may require an academic accommodation due to a qualified disability, physical or mental, please register with the Moses Center 212-998-4980. Please let your instructor know if you need help connecting to these resources.

## Statement on use of Electronic Devices

Laptops will be an essential part of the course and may be used in class during workshops and for taking notes in lecture. Laptops must be closed during class discussions and student presentations.  Phone use in class is strictly prohibited unless directly related to a presentation of your own work or if you are asked to do so as part of the curriculum.
